                <li>- 2 pats of butter</li>

            <h2>Process:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
                <li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
                <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
                <li>Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
                <li>Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
                <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
                <li>Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
                <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown
                    (approximately 1 to 2
                    minutes)</li>
                <li>Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>

            </ol>

        <p>Note:
            Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be
            much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
            <p>Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
