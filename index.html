            <ol>
         <li>1. Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
         <li>2. Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
         <li>3. Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
         <li>4. Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
         <li>5. Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
         <li>6. Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
         <li>7. Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
         <li>8. Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2
            minutes)</li>
         <li>9. Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>

Note:
Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be
much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".
